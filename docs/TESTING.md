# Testing & end-to-end verification

How to build, run, screenshot, and end-to-end verify rai against a live `herdr`
daemon — without disrupting anyone's running agents.

## Build & run a dev build

`scripts/bundle.sh` compiles a release build, wraps it in `Rai.app`, code-signs
it, and installs to `/Applications` (falling back to `~/Applications`).

```sh
./scripts/bundle.sh          # arm64 dev build → /Applications/Rai.app
open -a Rai
```

Env overrides:

| var | effect |
| --- | --- |
| `RAI_VERSION` | `CFBundleShortVersionString` (default `0.1.0`) |
| `RAI_UNIVERSAL=1` | universal arm64 + x86_64 binary (used by the release workflow) |
| `RAI_APP_DEST` | install into this dir instead of `/Applications` |
| `RAI_SIGN_IDENTITY` | codesign identity. A stable local identity (e.g. a self-signed `rai-dev-signing`) keeps macOS TCC grants — like Input Monitoring for the Codex Micro — alive across rebuilds, because the code requirement stays constant. Falls back to ad-hoc when the identity is absent (CI, other machines). |

For a quick loop without bundling, `swift run rai` runs straight from the package.

## Unit tests

```sh
swift test
```

Heads-up: the Homebrew Swift toolchain frequently lacks XCTest, so `swift test`
can fail locally with an XCTest/linker error even when the code is fine. In that
case `swift build` is the local compile gate, and CI is the source of truth —
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the full suite on `macos-15` with Xcode 16.x
(pinned because SwiftTerm ships a `.metal` shader that only the Xcode-bundled
Metal toolchain can compile).

## Screenshot the running app

Bring rai to the front, read its window bounds, and capture just that window:

```sh
osascript -e 'tell application "Rai" to activate'
RECT=$(osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to tell process "Rai" \
  to get {position, size} of front window' | tr -d ' ')   # → "x,y,w,h"
screencapture -x -o -R"$RECT" rai.png
```

- The `System Events` step needs **Accessibility** permission for the terminal
  running it. If it's denied, fall back to a full-screen grab:
  `screencapture -x -o rai.png`.
- `-x` silences the shutter; `-o` drops the window shadow.
- Retina displays capture at 2× — a 1512×949 window yields a 3024×1898 png.

## End-to-end checks against herdr — without disrupting live work

rai is a GUI client for the `herdr` daemon, which holds **real, running** agent
sessions. The cardinal rule:

> **Never split, close, or refocus another person's active agents.** Do all
> structural testing in isolated, throwaway workspaces created with `--no-focus`,
> and clean them up when done.

Inspecting state is always safe — the snapshot is read-only, and its array order
is the canonical (sidebar) order, so don't re-sort by `number`:

```sh
herdr api snapshot           # full ordered workspaces → tabs → panes + statuses
```

Throwaway-workspace pattern (this is how the reopen-tab and slot-ordering
behavior were verified live):

```sh
# create WITHOUT stealing focus, then find the new workspace id by diffing
before=$(herdr api snapshot | jq -r '.result.snapshot.workspaces[].workspace_id')
herdr workspace create --cwd /tmp --no-focus
after=$(herdr api snapshot | jq -r '.result.snapshot.workspaces[].workspace_id')
ws=$(comm -13 <(echo "$before" | sort) <(echo "$after" | sort))

# …exercise tab/pane/agent commands in "$ws", re-inspect via `herdr api snapshot`…

herdr workspace close "$ws"  # ALWAYS clean up
```

Rules that keep tests non-disruptive and correct:

- Pass `--no-focus` on every `create` / `agent start` so the user's view never
  jumps.
- For structure tests, use a dummy "agent" instead of a real model:
  `herdr agent start test --tab <id> --no-focus -- /bin/sh -lc "exec sh"`.
- A freshly created tab already has a **default shell pane**; `agent start`
  adds the agent in a **second** pane. Account for that (rai closes the leftover
  default pane on tab reopen for exactly this reason).
- herdr refuses to close the **last** tab in a workspace
  (`{"code":"tab_close_failed"}`).
- Close every throwaway workspace when finished.

### herdr command quick reference

| command | purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `herdr api snapshot` | full runtime state (workspaces/tabs/panes/agents), canonical order |
| `herdr workspace create [--cwd P] [--focus\|--no-focus]` | new workspace (response includes the `root_pane`) |
| `herdr tab create --workspace <id> [--cwd P] [--label L] [--no-focus]` | new tab (seeds one default pane) |
| `herdr agent start <name> --tab <id> [--split right\|down] [--no-focus] -- <argv…>` | run a process as a tracked agent (adds a pane) |
| `herdr pane send-text <paneID> <text>` | type text into a pane |
| `herdr pane send-keys <paneID> <key>` | send a key (`Enter`, `Escape`, `C-c`, …) |
| `herdr pane split <paneID> --direction <right\|down>` / `pane close <paneID>` | split / close a pane |
| `herdr workspace close <id>` / `herdr tab close <id>` | tear down |

The `poc/herdr_client.py` client (see the README) exercises the same socket in
Python if you'd rather not shell out.
